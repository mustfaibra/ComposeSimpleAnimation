# ComposeSimpleAnimation
Trying to play with Jetpack compose low level animations APIs, which are animate*AsState APIs that I needed in another project.

# What Am I trying to do?
I had a project where some items and images must be floating with some cool rotations, so I need a small project to test my options out, and we are here!

# Other resources?
You can check out the High level animations APIs that make the process more faster and easier to understand, even for complex cases like cross fading animations and the other alien's stuff ðŸ¤£

You can find it all here, in this official [documentation](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/animation).
